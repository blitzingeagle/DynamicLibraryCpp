# Implementing Dynamic Libraries in C++ - Starter Code

This repository provides a basic example on how to create dynamic libraries (`.dll`, `.so`, `.dynlib`) by C++. These dynamic libraries bundle executable code and can be shared across multiple applications written in different languages. Examples on how to call the 
library functions are included.
